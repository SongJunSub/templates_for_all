# Trying to Apply Kafka 2.8.0 with Spring Kafka

When I applied gradle setting and spring kafka version 

```

implementation 'org.springframework.kafka:spring-kafka:2.7.7'

```

but when I checked spring boot logs,

```

2021-09-22 21:46:29.009  INFO 64311 --- [           main] o.a.kafka.common.utils.AppInfoParser     : Kafka version: 2.7.1

```

and I faced with the problem that was connected with kafka. I am checking.
